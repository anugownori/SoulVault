# SoulVault

SoulVault is an emotional legacy app that lets users preserve memories, voice, and personality so loved ones can “interact” with them after they're gone. More than a storage app, SoulVault is a digital continuation of self — helping people feel connected, not just remember.

## Core Idea

- **Emotional legacy system**: Securely saves text, audio, video, and emotional context.
- **AI chatbot**: Trains on user’s memories to create a realistic digital avatar.
- **Legacy transfer**: Allows users to choose who accesses their legacy after death.
- **Biometric security**: Protects all data with fingerprint/face/DNA unlock.
- **Future compatibility**: Ready to expand with DNA-driven AI, 3D memory worlds, time capsule unlocks.

## MVP Features

1. **AI Memory Chatbot** — Trained on user memories (OpenAI API) for real dialogue.
2. **Emotional Memory Vault** — Biometrically-locked, encrypted storage.
3. **Grief Companion Mode** — Loved ones interact with the AI persona.
4. **Time Capsule Memories** — Messages that unlock with time/event triggers.
5. **Legacy Transfer System** — Legal/digital death verifier passes access.
6. **AI Diary** — Daily log summaries to “life chapters.”
7. **(Future) 3D Memory Worlds** — Interactive VR/AR memory immersion.
8. **Subscription Model** — Basic storage, premium AI/3D.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (mobile, cross-platform)
- **Backend**: Firebase (auth, storage, functions, biometrics integration)
- **AI layer**: OpenAI API
- **Budget**: ₹5K–₹10K (MVP first, then phased expansion)
